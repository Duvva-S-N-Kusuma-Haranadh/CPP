// Write a C++ program that will accept the following information for each team in a cricket or a football league.

// General Information
// Team name
// Number of wins
// Number of losses

// For a cricket team, add the following information:
// No. of fours
// No. of sixes
// No. of runs
// No. of ties

// For a football team, add the following information:
// No. of goals
// No. of ties
// No. of penalties

// Step:1
// Enter this information for all of the teams in the league. Then reorder and print the list of teams according to their win-lose records. Store the information in an array of structures, where each array elements (i.e. each structure) contains the information for a single team.

// Make use of a Structure to represent the variable information (either cricket or football) that is included as a part of the structure. This Structure should itself contain two structures, one for cricket â€“ related statistics and the other for football related statistics.

// Note: use enum type in comparing menu options.
// Note : Try executing the code in your own compiler to test for different inputs and get the desired output.
